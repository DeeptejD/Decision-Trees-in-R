# Decision Tree Analysis in R (Titanic Dataset)

This repository contains an analysis of the **Titanic** using **Decision Trees in R**. The project demonstrates how to preprocess data, build a decision tree model & visualize it.

A Decision Tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It models decisions based on feature values, splitting data into branches at each node. [Read More](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree)

## Dataset

The dataset used is a cleaned version of the **Titanic dataset** from Kaggle. It contains the following features:

- ```Survived```: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- ```Pclass```: Ticket class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- ```Sex```: Gender (Male, Female)
- ```Age```: Age of passenger
- ```SibSp```: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- ```Parch```: Number of parents/children aboard
- ```Fare```: Ticket fare

## Steps to run
> To run this project, ensure you have **R** and **RStudio** installed.
1. Clone the respository: ```https://github.com/DeeptejD/Decision-Trees-in-R```
2. Open decision_tree.R in RStudio.
3.  Run the script to:
   - Load and preprocess the Titanic dataset.
   - Train a decision tree model.
   - Visualize the decision tree.
   - Evaluate model performance.
